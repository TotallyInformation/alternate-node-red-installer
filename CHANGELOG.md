# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

alternate-node-red-installer adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/alternate-node-red-installer/compare/v2.0.2...master)

### Added

- `backup.sh`, `backupw.sh`, and `backupm.sh` BASH scripts to efficiently back up your working Node-RED installation if installed using this alternate installer.
  
  The scripts should be run from CRON daily, weekly and monthly respectively.

  ```text
  # Node-RED daily backup (3AM every day)
  0 3 * * * "/home/home/nrmain"/backup.sh > /dev/null
  # Node-RED weekly backup (03:30 every Sunday)
  30 3 * * 0 "/home/home/nrmain"/backupw.sh > /dev/null
  # Node-RED monthly backup (04:00 on the first of every month)
  0 4 1 * * "/home/home/nrmain"/backupm.sh > /dev/null
  ```

  They give you 7 days of daily backups, 5 weekly backups, and 12 monthly backups. They should be easy enough to adapt to whatever schedule you want.

  Output from the scripts are written to syslog, review with `sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep nrmain-backup` or `sudo journalctl -t nrmain-backup`.

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/alternate-node-red-installer/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.2)
### Breaking

- Node.js v10 is now the minimum version due to dependency module changes.

### Added

- [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and [TODO](./TODO.md) files.
- Two command line commands are now available if you install this package globally:
   - `alternate-node-red-installer` - OK, so this is a bit long and I can never remember it myself!
   - `nrinstall` - Yes, that's a bit more memorable. ðŸ˜Ž

### Changed

- Bump to v2.0 due to breaking change. And to v2.0.1 for the extra command name.
- Bump dependencies to latest versions.
- Tidy and improve code.
- Install now sets correct paths in `./system/node-red-service` and `./data/envfile.ini`.
